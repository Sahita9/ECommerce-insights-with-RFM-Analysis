# ECommerce-Insights-with-RFM-Analysis
In this project , we worked with the eCommerce dataset provided: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

Created a Customer Segmentation model using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method. RFM segmentation is a
powerful technique used by businesses to group customers based on their recent purchasing
behavior, purchase frequency, and monetary value, enabling more targeted marketing and
customer engagement strategies.
